# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## v0.4.1 — 2026-05-19

### Added — prompt externalization + SHACL validation gate

- **SHACL validation step** between LLM-generated triples and Fuseki load.
  Triples that fail validation are filtered out; full violation detail
  (focus node, result path, message, severity) is surfaced through the
  new `PopulationResult.violations` field.
- **`ontorag learn derive-shapes <schema.ttl> [-o out.ttl]`** — generates
  a SHACL skeleton from an OWL TBox using three mechanical mappings:
  `rdfs:range xsd:T` → `sh:datatype`, `rdfs:range <Class>` → `sh:class` +
  `sh:nodeKind sh:IRI`, `owl:FunctionalProperty` → `sh:maxCount 1`.
  Domain knowledge (enumerations, value ranges, cardinality > 1) is
  refined by hand afterwards.
- **`--shapes PATH` option** on `ontorag learn populate` and
  `ontorag learn populate-structured`. Optional; default preserves the
  prior v0.4.0 behaviour (no SHACL step). When the file is missing the
  CLI logs a warning and proceeds without validation.
- **Pre-authored shapes** for all five example domains —
  `examples/{pokemon,techstack,ods,pure_land,commerce}/shapes.ttl` —
  with realistic OWL-inexpressible constraints (Pokémon types ≤ 2,
  HP ∈ [1, 999], ISO 4217 currency regex, vowNumber ∈ [1, 48], etc.).
- **Six prompts moved to package resources** under
  `src/ontorag/learn/prompts/` and `src/ontorag/chat/prompts/`, loaded
  via `importlib.resources`. Byte-identical to v0.4.0 inline strings
  (verified against git HEAD). Per-domain overrides not introduced in
  v0.4.1 — single source of truth at package level.
- **CLI shows SHACL drop count** — `⚠ SHACL 위반으로 N건 제외됨` follows
  the load summary when violations were filtered.

### Fixed

- `cli_learn._load()` now unpacks the new `(loaded_count, violations)`
  tuple returned by `LLMOntologyLearner._load_triples`. Without this
  fix the `populate` and `populate-structured` commands would have
  crashed with `TypeError: unsupported format string passed to
  tuple.__format__` once they reached the load step.

### Documentation

- `README.md` / `README.ko.md` — new four-step SHACL walkthrough with
  real input TTL, real derive-shapes output, hand-refinement diff,
  expected CLI output, and a Python SDK example that iterates
  `PopulationResult.violations`. Closes with a five-domain shapes
  summary table.
- Quick-reference CLI block in both READMEs lists `derive-shapes` and
  the `--shapes` option on the two populate commands.

### Notes

- Backwards compatible: every existing v0.4.0 invocation continues to
  work unchanged. SHACL is opt-in via `--shapes` and the new Python
  kwarg.
- `pyshacl>=0.25.0` was already declared in v0.4.0 dependencies — no
  new top-level requirement.
- Tests: +11 in `tests/test_learn_shacl.py` (validate + derive_from_owl).
  Full learn + cli regression: 159 passing.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-05-19

### Added — 4-domain RAGAS final benchmark + decision-grid guide

- **4-domain head-to-head RAGAS benchmark** with `gpt-4o` as both agent
  and judge — Pure Land (50q, ko), ODS (20q, en), Pokemon (20q, ko),
  Techstack (20q, ko). Full result JSONs under each
  `examples/<domain>/bench_results/`.
- **New goldsets** — `examples/pokemon/goldset.jsonl` and
  `examples/techstack/goldset.jsonl` (20q each, easy/medium/hard/trap
  distribution, hard cases exercising the respective
  TransitiveProperty closures).
- **`examples/pokemon/README.md`** — new domain README (rationale,
  TBox/ABox summary, evolution chains, RAGAS table).
- **`RAGAS_JUDGE_MODEL` env-var fallback** in
  `src/ontorag/eval/metrics/ragas_wrapper.py` for opt-in judge model
  selection (default remains `gpt-4o-mini`).
- **2×2 decision grid** (OWL richness × LLM contamination) in
  top-level `README.md` / `README.ko.md`, plotting all four domains
  with their qualitative outcomes.
- **Standardized `## Disclaimer` policy** across all five example
  READMEs (Pokemon · Techstack · ODS · Pure Land · Commerce) with
  uniform 4-item structure: Rights / Nature / No affiliation /
  Takedown commitment. Pokemon disclaimer is bilingual EN+KO due to
  trademark sensitivity.
- **BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md v9 section** — 4-domain cross-comparison
  with OWL-feature-richness × RAGAS-win correlation analysis.

### Changed — README structure and disclaimers

- Top-level READMEs now include a "Benchmark results — 4-domain RAGAS
  final (2026-05)" section between "Evaluation Harness" and "Roadmap",
  with three findings explained in plain prose: (1) RAGAS Faithfulness
  has a chunk-quote style bias; (2) ontorag's edge grows with OWL
  feature richness; (3) Hallucination 0% and Citation 45-66% are
  ontorag-exclusive — and the "—" entries for LangChain mean
  "not measurable", not "zero".
- Pure Land's existing "Disclaimer / 면책 조항" section renamed to
  "Doctrinal Disclaimer / 교리적 면책 조항" to separate religious
  doctrinal scope from copyright/attribution; new standard
  "## Disclaimer" section added separately.
- Cross-domain attribution footnote now describes the **policy**
  (4 items, uniform location) rather than enumerating ad hoc per-domain
  notices.

### Fixed — merged accumulated v2-v8 surgical fixes from eval-harness

- `src/ontorag/core/sparql.py` — case-insensitive `rdfs:label`
  equality with lang-literal support.
- `src/ontorag/stores/base.py` — `PropertySummary` / `ClassSummary`
  extended with `description`, `is_transitive`, `inverse_of_uri`.
- `src/ontorag/stores/fuseki.py` — `get_schema` now extracts
  `owl:TransitiveProperty`, `owl:inverseOf`, `rdfs:comment`,
  `skos:definition`.
- `src/ontorag/chat/agent.py` — TBox-driven prompt generation
  (`rdfs:comment` + OWL flags rendered into the system prompt); system
  prompt reduced from ~60 to ~25 lines; `property_path_query` tool
  added with three modes (start_uri / start_label / start_class_uri).

### Notes

- During the eval-harness → main merge, 4 files in `src/` had conflicts
  with main's `ae3c308 fix(core): multilingual label equality +
  TBox-driven prompt generalisation`. Resolution chose eval-harness
  versions throughout — all `bench_results/*.json` in this release were
  produced against that code; `ae3c308`'s parallel approach to the
  same OWL semantics surface is subsumed by the broader eval-harness
  treatment.

  - `Content-Disposition: attachment` 헤더 포함 → 브라우저 직접 다운로드
  - target=all + format=xlsx 시 TBox/ABox를 별도 시트로 분리
- **Web UI 다운로드 버튼** — Schema 탭과 Data 탭에 📥 다운로드 섹션 추가

## v0.3.1 — 2026-05-18

### Added — Structured ABox Population

- **`ontorag learn populate-structured`** — reads CSV/JSON/JSONL, maps columns to TBox property URIs via LLM, converts each row to RDF triples, loads to Fuseki
  - Column mapping cached in `<file>.mapping.json` — second run reuses it with zero LLM calls
  - `--class-uri` — TBox class URI for each row (e.g. `pk:Pokemon`)
  - `--id-column` — column to use as subject URI slug; deterministic uuid5 if omitted (idempotent across re-runs)
  - `--batch-size` (default 50) — rows per LLM mapping call
  - `--min-confidence` (default 0.7) — column mapping confidence threshold
  - `--yes` — skip Fuseki load confirmation prompt
  - Nested JSON keys flattened with dotted notation: `{"stats":{"hp":35}}` → `stats.hp`

### Fixed

- `propose_mapping` swallowed all exceptions with a bare `except Exception: return []` — network/auth errors are now re-raised so the CLI shows the real cause; JSON parse errors (recoverable) still return `[]`
- `mint_subject_uri` only replaced spaces with underscores — special characters (apostrophes, colons, hashes) in id-column values produced invalid URI path segments; fixed with `urllib.parse.quote(safe="-._~")`
- `populate_from_structured` ran the full LLM pipeline before detecting an empty TBox, giving a misleading "no triples generated" message; now raises `ValueError` early with actionable guidance

## v0.3.0 — 2026-05-18

### Added — LLMs4OL Ontology Learning pipeline

- **`ontorag learn` CLI** — four commands for LLMs4OL tasks (A/B/C + full pipeline):
  - `type-term` — map a text mention to the most likely TBox class (Task A)
  - `taxonomy` — propose `rdfs:subClassOf` relations from text evidence (Task B)
  - `extract` — extract RDF triples with schema-validated predicate URIs (Task C)
  - `populate` — run A+B+C, preview results in a Rich table, confirm before loading
- **`POST /tools/learn/type-term`** and **`POST /tools/learn/extract-triples`** — two new MCP-exposed API endpoints (L1, `fastapi-mcp` auto-converts to MCP tools)
- **`LLMOntologyLearner`** — concrete `OntologyLearner` protocol implementation backed by an LLM provider + GraphStore; fetches live TBox at call time — no stale schema cache
- **`SchemaResult.properties`** — new field on `SchemaResult` populated by `FusekiStore.get_schema()`; enables Task C predicate validation without N+1 `get_class_detail()` calls
- **`force_tool_name` parameter** on `AnthropicProvider.complete()` and `OpenAIProvider.complete()` — maps to `tool_choice={"type":"tool","name":"..."}` / `{"type":"function","function":{"name":"..."}}`, guarantees structured JSON output for all LLMs4OL prompts
- **Tech Stack ontology example** (`examples/techstack/`) — demonstrates `owl:TransitiveProperty` inference on a dependency chain (Next.js → React → Node.js) and LLMs4OL extension from `corpus.txt`
- **`cli_learn.py`** — learn command group extracted from `cli.py` into a dedicated module

### Fixed
- `populate_from_text` called LLM pipeline twice when `auto_load=True`; now runs once and reuses the stored result for the load step
- `PopulationResult` was mutated after construction; now constructed immutably in a single call
- `str(exc)` leaked internal exception details through HTTP 500 responses in learning routes; replaced with `logger.exception` + generic message

## v0.2.0 — 2026-05-17

### Added
- Web UI at `/ui` with three tabs: Schema (TBox graph), Data (ABox browser), Playground (LLM chat)
- Schema tab: interactive Cytoscape.js class hierarchy graph, TBox upload, SHACL/syntax validation
- Data tab: instance browser by class, entity detail side panel with depth-2 neighbourhood graph, ABox upload with append/replace mode
- Playground tab: real-time tool-call display, result graph visualization, session management, in-browser LLM config
- Rate-limit SSE event (`rate_limit`) with animated banner and automatic retry (up to 3 attempts)
- Forced tool-use on first LLM turn when ontology has data (`tool_choice: any` / `required`) — prevents LLM from answering from training knowledge instead of the graph
- RDF file upload endpoints: `POST /ui/schema/upload`, `POST /ui/data/upload`

### Fixed
- Cytoscape.js result graph not rendering on first query (double `requestAnimationFrame` defers init until container reflow)
- LLM skipping ontology queries for entities it recognises from training data (Pokémon, etc.)

## v0.1.0 — 2026-05-17

- 9 ontology-aware MCP tools (8 L1 intent + 1 L2 DSL)
- Anthropic / OpenAI / Ollama LLM providers
- FastAPI server with SSE streaming
- CLI: load, config, serve, chat, status
- Pokémon example ontology with TransitiveProperty demo
